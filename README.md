# BloomOps

Inventory and operations management for small florist businesses.

BloomOps lets you track products and stock levels, manage suppliers and incoming shipments, create and fulfil customer orders, and monitor sales and profit performance — all from a single dashboard backed by a live PostgreSQL database.

**Live demo:** [bloomops-production.up.railway.app](https://bloomops-production.up.railway.app) &nbsp;·&nbsp; `admin@bloomops.com` / `admin123`

## Features

**Dashboard** — KPI cards (active products, suppliers, low-stock count, stock value, orders and gross profit for the current month) plus rolling 12-month sales and profit charts.

**Products** — Create, edit, and archive products with SKU, category, unit, cost price, sell price, stock quantity, and minimum stock threshold. Searchable and filterable list with low-stock indicators.

**Suppliers** — Full supplier records with contact details. Detail page lists all active products linked to that supplier.

**Shipments** — Log incoming shipments from a supplier with line items and expected delivery. Track status from pending to received.

**Orders** — Customer orders with line items, delivery date, and contact info. Status lifecycle: draft → confirmed → fulfilled → cancelled. Cost is snapshotted at order time for accurate profit reporting.

**Reports** — Stock value by category, low-stock product list, top-selling products (last 12 months), monthly sales and gross profit tables.

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL running locally (or a [Neon](https://neon.tech) project)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bloomops.git
cd bloomops
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
# For local PostgreSQL
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<user>@localhost:5432/bloomops?schema=public"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://<user>@localhost:5432/bloomops?schema=public"

# Generate with: npx auth secret
AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-here"
```

`AUTH_URL` is not required locally — Auth.js auto-detects it.

### 3. Set up the database

```bash
createdb bloomops      # create local database
npm run db:push        # sync schema (no migration files)
npm run db:seed        # optional: load sample florist data
```

### 4. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) and log in with `admin@bloomops.com` / `admin123`.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Dev server on port 3002 |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run db:push` | Sync schema to local DB |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Create a migration (dev) |
| `npm run db:migrate:deploy` | Apply migrations (production) |
| `npm run db:seed` | Seed sample florist data |
| `npm run db:studio` | Open Prisma Studio |

---

## Deployment

BloomOps is deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app) with a PostgreSQL database. The `postinstall` script runs `prisma generate` automatically during the build. A `railway.json` config file is included in the repository.

Required environment variables in the Railway dashboard:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Railway PostgreSQL connection string |
| `DIRECT_URL` | Same as `DATABASE_URL` (Railway has no separate pooler) |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Random secret — generate with `npx auth secret` |
| `AUTH_URL` | Your Railway app URL, e.g. `https://bloomops-production.up.railway.app` |

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for the full step-by-step guide including schema setup and known production risks.

## Notes

- Authentication uses hardcoded demo credentials. Suitable for a private internal tool; not intended for public multi-user production use without replacing the auth layer.
- See [CASE_STUDY.md](CASE_STUDY.md) for a detailed write-up of implementation decisions, challenges, and planned v2 improvements.
